                    In Uganda's economic growth and increase in population, the amount of solid waste generated in 2016 increased to 7.81 million tonnes, up by 140,700 tonnes from 7.67 million tonnes in 2015. The amount of waste recycled in 2016 also increased by 119,300 tonnes, while the amount of waste disposed of increased marginally by 21,400 tonnes. The increase in the amount of waste recycled was largely due to an uptick in the amount of construction debris recycled. More premises started segregating food waste for recycling and food waste recycled increased by 7,000 tonnes. On the whole, the increase in total waste recycled was marginally higher than the increase in total waste generated. Thus, the overall recycling rate remained at 61 per cent.

                   <li> Our domestic waste recycling rate increased to 21 per cent in 2016, up from 19 per cent in 2015. </li>
                   <li> increase in the domestic waste recycling rate was due to a drop in the amount of domestic waste generated, from 2.13 million tonnes in 2015 to 2.09 million tonnes in 2016; and an increase in the amount of domestic waste recycled, from 403,500 tonnes in 2015 to 435,600 tonnes in 2016.</li>

            <h1>Facts on Waste</h1>
            <article>
                <p>In 2014, the total waste generated by all economic activities and households amounted to 2,503 million tonnes; this was the highest amount recorded during the period 2004-2014 (a time series only exists for even years).</p>

                <p>As might be expected, the overall amount of waste generated is related to some extent to the population and economic size of a country.</p>

                <p>The share of different economic activities and of households in total waste generation in 2014 is presented in the table below. Construction and metals contributed 34.7 % of the recycling rate in 2014 and was followed by the rest as shown:</p>

                        <header><strong>Liquid Waste</strong></header>
                        Liquid waste is commonly found both in households as well as in industries. This waste includes dirty water, organic liquids, wash water, waste detergents and even rainwater.

                        You should also know that liquid waste can be classified into point and non-point source waste. All manufactured liquid waste is classified as point source waste. On the other hand, natural liquid waste is classified as non-point source waste.

                        Tt is best get in touch with waste removal experts, such as 4 Waste Removals, to dispose of liquid waste properly.

                        Municipal Waste commonly consists of items we use on an everyday basis then dump it. Cloths, paints, wires, glasses, unwanted food, etc come under municipal waste. These waste come from schools, factories, but primarily come from our homes.

            <h1>Organic Waste</h1>
            <p>
                Organic waste is another common household. All food waste, garden waste, manure and rotten meat are classified as organic waste. Over time, organic waste is turned into manure by microorganisms. However, this does not mean that you can dispose them anywhere.
            </p> 

            <p>
                Organic waste in landfills causes the production of methane, so it must never be simply discarded with general waste. Instead, look to get a green bin from the Brisbane council, or hire a green skin bin or garden bag for proper waste disposal.
